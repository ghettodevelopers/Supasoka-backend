# Quick Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Removed NativeWind/TailwindCSS (was causing worklets error)
2. ✅ Updated babel.config.js
3. ✅ Converted DashboardScreen to StyleSheet
4. ✅ Installed expo-module-scripts (fixed tsconfig errors)
5. ✅ Reinstalled node_modules cleanly

## Current Status:
- **DashboardScreen**: ✅ Fully working with StyleSheet
- **Other Screens**: ⚠️ Still using className (will crash when navigated to)

## To Run App Now:
The app will start but only Dashboard will work. Other screens need conversion.

## Option 1: Quick Test (Dashboard Only)
Just run the app and test Dashboard screen - it should work perfectly.

## Option 2: Convert All Screens
I can convert all remaining screens to StyleSheet now (5-10 minutes).
